  # Introduction
---------------
### Objective:

Briefly describe the goal of the project, which is to predict customer churn in the telecom industry.

### Business Problem:
 
 Explain why churn prediction is important and how it can help the business retain customers.

### Data Overview:

 The dataset contains information about **7,043** telecom customers and their service usage patterns, demographics, and whether they churned or not. It has **21** columns, covering aspects like customer demographics, account details, services they have subscribed to, and their churn status. **Below are some key features:**

*  **Customer Information:**

   * `customerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
   * `gender`: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
   * `SeniorCitizen`: Whether the customer is a senior citizen (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
   * `tenure`: Indicates the total amount of months that the customer has been with the company. 
   * `Partner and Dependents`: Whether the customer has a partner or dependents.   

* **Service Information:**
  * `PhoneService`, `MultipleLines`: Whether the customer has phone service and multiple lines.
  * `InternetService`, `OnlineSecurity`, `OnlineBackup`, `DeviceProtection`, `TechSupport`, `StreamingTV`, `StreamingMovies`: Various internet services and support options the customer uses.

* **Account Information:**

  * `Contract`: Type of contract the customer has (Month-to-month, One year, Two years).
  * `PaperlessBilling`: Whether the customer has opted for paperless billing.
  * `PaymentMethod`: The customer’s method of payment (e.g., Electronic check, Mailed check).
  * `MonthlyCharges` and `TotalCharges`: Monthly and total charges for the customer.

* **Target Variable:**

  * `Churn`: Whether the customer churned (Yes/No).
  
This dataset is well-suited for churn prediction, providing various service and account attributes that can be used to understand patterns in customer churn.


## Project Outline:
------

>### Step 1: Data Assissment
>- Load the dataset and inspect its structure (check for missing values, data types, etc.).
>
>### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
>- Handle missing values, if any.
>- Normalize or scale numerical features (e.g., tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges) if necessary.
>
>
>### Step 3: Data Understanding and Exploration
>- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and how they relate to the target variable (Churn).
>- Visualize correlations and relationships between key features.
>
>### Step 4: Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
>- Encode categorical variables (e.g.InternetService) using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
>- Feature selection: Decide which features are most important for predicting churn.
>
>### Step 5: Splitting the Dataset
>- Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split) to evaluate model performance.
>
>### Step 6: Model Selection
>- Try different classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.
>- Train models using the training set.
>
>### Step 7: Model Evaluation
>- Evaluate the models on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.
>- Compare the models and choose the best one.
>
>### Step 8: Hyperparameter Tuning
>- Use techniques like grid search or random search to fine-tune the model for better performance.
>
>### Step 9: Final Model and Interpretation
>- Once you’ve selected the best model, interpret the results (e.g., which factors contribute most to churn).
>- Summarize the findings.
